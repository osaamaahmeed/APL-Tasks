1. The Difference between PyPy & Jython:
PyPy is a high-performance implementation of Python that focuses on speed by using a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler to translate Python code into machine code at runtime.
In contrast, Jython is an implementation designed to run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), compiling Python code into Java bytecode so it can run alongside Java applications.
While PyPy is typically used to make standard Python applications run faster, Jython is used specifically when you need seamless interoperability with Java libraries and the Java ecosystem.

PyPy: Web servers, data processing pipelines, scientific simulations
Jython: Enterprise applications needing Java libraries, Android development with Python
