1. Readability counts.
Working in teams is inevitable, so writing readable code should be non-negotiable. 
It ensures that other team members can easily understand your work. 
In a professional environment, clean code is essential so that any employee can maintain it without confusion.

2. Errors should never pass silently.
If you encounter an error, you should never skip it or plan to fix it "later."
A simple bug can escalate into a major issue if left unchecked.
Fixing it immediately might take a few minutes, whereas ignoring it could force you to rewrite hundreds of lines of code later.

3. Now is better than never.
The best time to start was yesterday; the next best time is today.
We should never postpone work, as that delay will eventually haunt us.
Since the work must be done regardless, it is far better to tackle it immediately rather than waiting.
